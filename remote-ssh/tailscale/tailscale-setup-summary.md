   - WireGuard protocol for security and performance
   - Private network between your devices only

## How to Connect

### From macOS to Linux
```bash
# Direct SSH using Tailscale IP
ssh chien@100.125.189.17

# Or using SSH config (if configured)
ssh linux-tailscale
```

### File Transfer
```bash
# Copy files from macOS to Linux
scp /path/to/local/file chien@100.125.189.17:/path/on/linux/

# Copy files from Linux to macOS
scp /path/on/linux/file user@100.83.80.118:/path/on/macos/
```

## Verification Tests Performed

1. **SSH Connection Test**: Successfully connected via SSH from macOS to Linux
2. **Local SSH Test**: Successfully connected to localhost on Linux
3. **Tailscale Status**: Both machines show as connected in the Tailscale network

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- Keep Tailscale updated on both machines
- Keep SSH and system packages updated
- Monitor for security updates

### Monitoring
- Check Tailscale status: `tailscale status`
- View connected devices: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
- Monitor SSH logs: `journalctl -u ssh`

## Troubleshooting

If connection issues occur:

1. **Check Tailscale Status**:
   ```bash
   tailscale status
   ```

2. **Verify SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```

3. **Test Network Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ping 100.125.189.17  # From macOS
   ping 100.83.80.118   # From Linux
   ```

4. **Check Firewall Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

## Future Enhancements to Consider

1. **Firewall Configuration**: Set up UFW with appropriate rules
2. **Tailscale SSH Feature**: Enable Tailscale's built-in SSH for additional security
3. **Subnet Routing**: Share your entire home network securely
4. **Exit Node**: Use your home connection as a VPN from anywhere

## Account Information

- **Tailscale Account**: Managed at https://login.tailscale.com/
- **Devices**: Currently 2 devices connected (Linux and macOS)

## Conclusion

Your remote access solution is now fully set up and secured. You can securely connect from your macOS in Los Angeles to your Linux workstation in San Jose using Tailscale's encrypted network and SSH key authentication.
