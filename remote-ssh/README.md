# Remote SSH Access for NVIDIA Development Workstation

## Overview
This guide documents industry-standard solutions for securely accessing a remote NVIDIA-powered workstation for robotics AI training using Isaac Sim, Omniverse, and related technologies.

## Requirements
- Home workstation in San Jose with NVIDIA RTX 4070
- Remote access needed from Los Angeles
- Secure, robust SSH solution for individual research and development
- Support for graphics-intensive applications (Isaac Sim, Omniverse)

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. OpenSSH with X11 Forwarding
**Basic remote terminal access with graphical forwarding capabilities**

- Industry standard, built into most Linux distributions
- Secure with proper configuration
- Supports X11 forwarding for basic GUI applications

### 2. SSH Tunneling with VNC/RDP
**Better performance for graphical applications**

- SSH tunnel for security + VNC/RDP for desktop access
- Options:
  - TigerVNC - open-source, good performance
  - RealVNC - commercial option with better features
  - xrdp - RDP server for Linux

### 3. Tailscale/ZeroTier + SSH
**Modern mesh VPN approach**

- Creates secure overlay network between devices
- Simplifies firewall/NAT traversal
- Adds an additional security layer
- Works well with dynamic IPs

### 4. NVIDIA Specific: Omniverse Streaming
**Purpose-built for NVIDIA visualization workloads**

- Designed specifically for Omniverse applications
- Optimized for low-latency streaming of GPU-accelerated content
- Requires Omniverse subscription

## Security Best Practices

1. **Key-based Authentication**
   - Disable password authentication
   - Use ED25519 or RSA 4096-bit keys
   - Protect private keys with strong passphrases

2. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Restrict SSH access by IP if possible
   - Use non-standard ports (optional, security by obscurity)
   - Configure fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks

3. **SSH Hardening**
   - Disable root login
   - Use SSH protocol version 2
   - Limit user access
   - Configure idle timeout

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep all software updated
   - Apply security patches promptly

5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Consider implementing 2FA for SSH
   - Options include Google Authenticator, Yubikey
