# Remote Access Solution Progress Tracking

## Project Goal
Create a complete remote access solution to connect from macOS in Los Angeles to NVIDIA Linux workstation in San Jose, with optimized support for Isaac Sim and NVIDIA Omniverse applications.

## Progress Overview

| Phase | Component | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | Basic SSH Setup | ⚠️ PARTIAL | SSH server configured but router port forwarding pending |
| **Phase 2** | Tailscale VPN | ✅ COMPLETE | Secure network connection established |
| **Phase 3** | NVIDIA Omniverse Streaming | 🔄 PENDING | Not yet started |
| **Phase 4** | Additional Remote Desktop | ✅ PARTIAL | NoMachine installed on Linux, client setup pending on macOS |
| **Security** | SSH Hardening | ✅ COMPLETE | Password auth disabled, fail2ban installed |
| **Security** | Firewall Configuration | 🔄 PENDING | Not yet configured |

## Detailed Progress

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED TASKS

#### Phase 1: Basic SSH Setup
- ✅ OpenSSH server installed on Linux workstation
- ✅ SSH server configured securely
- ✅ SSH key-based authentication set up
- ✅ SSH connection tested and working on local network
- ⚠️ Router port forwarding NOT configured (requires admin access to router in San Jose)
  - Cannot access router admin interface (owned by dad)
  - Direct SSH access from outside the local network NOT possible yet
  - **Note**: Tailscale VPN (Phase 2) provides a workaround for this limitation

### ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

#### Phase 2: Tailscale VPN Setup
- ✅ Tailscale account created
- ✅ Tailscale installed on Linux workstation (v1.82.0)
- ✅ Tailscale installed on macOS machine
- ✅ Both machines connected to Tailscale network
- ✅ SSH over Tailscale tested and working
- ✅ Network configuration documented:
  - Linux Tailscale IP: 100.125.189.17
  - macOS Tailscale IP: 100.83.80.118

#### Phase 4: Additional Remote Desktop Solutions
- ✅ NoMachine server installed on Linux (Version 8.16.1)
- ✅ NoMachine service running on port 4000
- ✅ NoMachine setup guide created for macOS client installation
- 🔄 NoMachine client installation on macOS pending
- 🔄 NoMachine connection testing pending

#### Security Enhancements
- ✅ Password authentication disabled on SSH
- ✅ Fail2ban installed and configured
- ✅ SSH configuration backed up

### 🔄 PENDING TASKS

#### Phase 3: NVIDIA Omniverse Streaming Setup
- 🔄 Install NVIDIA Omniverse on workstation
  - Omniverse Launcher
  - Omniverse Nucleus
  - Omniverse Streaming Core
  - Isaac Sim
- 🔄 Configure Omniverse Streaming
- 🔄 Install Omniverse Streaming Client on macOS
- 🔄 Test Omniverse Streaming connection
- 🔄 Optimize streaming settings for performance

#### Additional Security
- 🔄 Configure UFW firewall
  - Allow SSH
  - Allow Tailscale
  - Allow Omniverse Streaming ports
- 🔄 Set up automatic updates

#### Automation and Persistence
- 🔄 Create startup scripts for Omniverse Streaming
- 🔄 Configure systemd service for automatic startup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: NVIDIA Omniverse Setup
1. Install NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher on Linux workstation
2. Install required Omniverse components:
   - Nucleus
   - Streaming Core
   - Isaac Sim
3. Configure Omniverse Streaming
4. Install Omniverse Streaming Client on macOS
5. Test streaming connection and performance

### Secondary Priority: Additional Remote Desktop
1. Evaluate if additional remote desktop solution is needed after testing Omniverse Streaming
2. If needed, set up either VNC+VirtualGL or NoMachine

### Final Steps
1. Complete firewall configuration
2. Set up automation for startup and updates
3. Document final configuration
4. Create backup and recovery plan
