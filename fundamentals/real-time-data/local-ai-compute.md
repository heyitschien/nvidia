# Local AI Compute Setup Guide
## Setting Up Development Environment for Robotics and AI

## Overview
This guide covers setting up a local development environment for AI and robotics development, with a focus on Apple Silicon (M-series) machines and Nvidia's new technologies.

## Nvidia Digits Personal AI Supercomputer
- Starting price: $3,000
- Capabilities:
  - Run models up to 200B parameters
  - Two units can run 405B parameter models (e.g., Meta's Llama)
  - Local AI processing without cloud dependency
  - Supports agentic AI development

## Development Environment Setup

### Apple Silicon Setup (M-series)
1. Virtualization Options:
   - UTM for Linux VM
   - Parallels Desktop for Mac
   - Docker with ARM-compatible images

2. Docker Configuration:
   ```bash
   # Example Docker setup for robotics development
   docker pull ros:humble # ROS 2 Humble for ARM64
   docker pull nvidia/isaac-sim:latest # When ARM support is available
   ```

3. Remote Development:
   - Cloud GPU instances for heavy computation
   - Remote development environments
   - VSCode remote extensions

### Local Tools and Frameworks
1. ROS 2 Installation:
   - Native installation on Linux VM
   - Docker container setup
   - Development tools and extensions

2. Nvidia Isaac Setup:
   - Isaac Sim installation
   - Omniverse connection
   - Groot n1 framework integration

3. AI Development Tools:
   - Local model deployment
   - Inference optimization
   - Model compression techniques
