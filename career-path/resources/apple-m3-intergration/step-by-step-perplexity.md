To get started with Docker on your MacBook M3 Ultra, you don't need to install a full virtual machine to run Linux. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Mac**: Download and install Docker Desktop from the Docker website. It includes everything you need to run Docker containers on macOS.

2. **Start Docker Desktop**: Once installed, launch Docker Desktop from your Applications folder.

3. **Set Up VS Code Integration**: Install the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code from the Extensions Marketplace. This lets you manage and deploy containers directly from your IDE.

4. **Explore NVIDIA Omniverse**: You can access NVIDIA's cloud services for Omniverse and other AI tools. You might need to sign up for NVIDIA's cloud services and follow their documentation for specific setup instructions.

5. **Learn the Workflow**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of Docker, such as creating Dockerfiles, building images, and running containers.

6. **Integrate with Robotics Tools**: Look into NVIDIA's Isaac Sim for simulation and learn how to deploy AI models onto robotic platforms.

By following these steps, you'll have a development environment set up to work with Docker, VS Code, and NVIDIA's tools for robotic interfacing and AI training.To get started with Docker on your MacBook M3 Ultra, you don't need to install a full virtual machine to run Linux.
