# NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides information about NVIDIA Isaac Sim, its integration with ROS 2, and how to use it for virtual robotics development without physical hardware.

## Can I Use Isaac Sim Without a Physical Robot?

**Yes, absolutely!** NVIDIA Isaac Sim is specifically designed as a simulation platform that allows you to:

- Design, simulate, and test robot models in a virtual environment
- Generate synthetic data for training AI models
- Perform software-in-the-loop testing
- Develop and validate robotics applications without physical hardware

## Key Features of Isaac Sim

### Pre-Populated Robots and SimReady Assets

Isaac Sim includes many third-party robot models built on OpenUSD with ideal physics properties:

- **Humanoids**: 1X, Agility, Fourier Intelligence, and Sanctuary
- **Manipulators**: Fanuc, KUKA, Universal Robots, and Techman
- **Quadrupeds**: ANYbotics, Boston Dynamics, and Unitree
- **AMRs**: idealworks, iRobot

### Bootstrapped AI Model Development

Bootstrap AI model training with synthetic data generation, especially useful where real-world data is limited or restricted.

### Scalable Testing and Validation

Test a single robot or an entire fleet operating in complex and dynamic environments under various conditions and configurations.

### Modular Architecture for Robotics Workflows

Develop custom workflows for various types of robots, such as humanoids, manipulators, and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).

### Realistic Physics Simulation

Utilize NVIDIA PhysX for physics capabilities like mimic joints, as well as rigid and soft-body collisions.

## Starter Kits

### Sensor Simulation

Simulate ground-truth perception and physics-based sensors including:
- Vision-based sensors
- RADAR
- Lidar
- Contact sensors
- IMUs
- Custom sensors

### ROS Support

- Custom ROS2 messages and URDF/MJCF are now open-source
- Support for custom ROS messages that allow standalone scripting to manually control simulation steps

## Isaac Sim with ROS 2 Workflow

The Isaac Sim to ROS 2 workflow is similar to workflows executed with other robot simulators such as Gazebo. At a high level:

1. Import your robot model into a prebuilt Isaac Sim environment
2. Add sensors to the robot
3. Connect the relevant components to the ROS 2 action graph
4. Simulate the robot by controlling it through your ROS 2 packages

### URDF: A Common Starting Point

- The ROS 2 workflow in Isaac Sim usually starts with importing the robot model through the URDF importer
- URDF is a widely accepted format for working with robot models in simulation tools
- A built-in wizard helps introduce additional files, data, and environments from third-party tools and services

### Prepopulated Scenes and SimReady Assets

- Isaac Sim offers many prebuilt 3D scenes, from simple office environments to large complex environments like warehouses
- You can bring more complex 3D scenes from other tools through USD Connections
- Over a thousand SimReady assets are available, which are physically accurate 3D objects with accurate physical properties and behavior

### Adding Sensors

- Isaac Sim includes many third-party sensors from manufacturers such as Intel, Orbbec, Stereolabs, HESAI, SICK, SLAMTEC, and more
- You can also build your own custom sensor for simulation
- NVIDIA RTX technology enables generating photorealistic images from physically accurate simulation

### Connecting to ROS 2

- Isaac Sim connects to ROS 2 through the ROS 2 Bridge extension
- This extension consists of various OmniGraph (OG) nodes designed for ROS developers
- OG nodes provide encapsulated functionality that can be used in a connected graph structure
- The ROS 2 Bridge provides access to OG nodes for publishing data from simulated sensors, publishing transform trees, and subscribing to velocity messages
- Enabling the ROS 2 Bridge gives access to rclpy, the ROS 2 client library for Python
- Custom message support is enabled by sourcing your workspace prior to running Isaac Sim

## Advanced Capabilities

### Scaling from Simple to Complex Simulations

- The OpenUSD foundation of Isaac Sim makes it highly extensible and scalable
- You can scale from single robots in a work cell to multiple robots in complex environments like factories or warehouses

### Synthetic Data Generation for Model Training

- Sensors in Isaac Sim can generate synthetic data for training perception AI models
- Domain randomization allows changing parameters like location, lighting, color, texture, and background to generate diverse training data
- Synthetic data enables quick iteration to improve model performance

### Multi-agent Software-in-Loop Testing

- Isaac Sim can test and validate the behavior and performance of entire fleets of robots
- Robots can run their own perception stack across multiple scenarios that would be difficult to cover in the real world

### Robot Learning

- Isaac Lab is a lightweight, open-source reference framework built on Isaac Sim for photorealistic and fast simulations
- It uses methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning
- Provides a way to scale robot policy training on multi-GPU and multi-node systems
